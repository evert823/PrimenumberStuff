# PrimenumberStuff
factorfinder.py tests if a number is prime.

PrintTransPrimeList.py identifies lists of n n-digit primes, in which you can transpose the digits resulting into another list of n n-digits primes.

PrintNextPrime helps you find the first next prime number from an entered value.

Example:

```
